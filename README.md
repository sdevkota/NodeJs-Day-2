# NodeJs-Day-2
This will show you how a module is wrapped up in a wrapper function and what are the parameters that are used to wrap the module. This is why every module data is scoped to it's module not to a global module. 
# The __filename and __dirname are parts of the module wrapper function 
#exports is same as module.exports
